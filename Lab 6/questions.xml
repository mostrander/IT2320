        <questiontext>Describe the purpose of AJAX. What advantage does AJAX provide over a traditional
                HTML form submit. [2 points]</questiontext>
        
        <answer id="answer1">The entire purpose of AJAX is to update a webpage WITHOUT having to 
            reload the entire webpage again to see the changes. It does so by loading the data 
            in the background, and thus allows for a more seamless user experience with minimal 
            load times, and by extension most likely lessens the overall burden on the server 
            the webpage is hosted on. </answer>

            either in a JSON or XML file, and then AJAX can be used within a JAvaScript file or script 
            to obtain the data from the external files. </answer>

    <question id="3">
        <questiontext>If you had to choose just one, which would you choose: XML or JSON? Why? [2 points]</questiontext>
        
        <answer id="answer3">I would have to choose JSON as my preferred option because it is capable 
                of being accessed directly through JavaScript without additional work or special workarounds; Also, 
                it is able to be written in a more condense format due to not requiring end tags, whereas XML 
                requires end tags to differentiate the data. Another important difference is XML is incapable 
                of utilizing arrays, whereas JSON can be formatted in an array.</answer>
