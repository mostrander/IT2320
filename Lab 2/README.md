### Today.html
This html document is designed to display a date in three different formats.

### Random.html
This html document is designed to output 100 random numbers from a randomly populated array. Two loops were used to make the script work properly; one array is used to populate the array with randomly generated numbers between 1 - 100, and another loop is used to output each array element on its own line. I also included a line to tell the user how many elements are in the array.

### Calculator.html
This html document is designed to take user input for two variables and output the results of three equations using the variable values provided when the user clicks a button. The equations equal '?' until values are provided and the button is pressed.
