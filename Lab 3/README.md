This lab assignment is about altering a prebuilt html document designed to take user input for an item description and item cost. It then places the information in a table that is displayed to the user console, where each new item is a new row. 

It is altered to add the costs of each item together into a totalBeforeTax variable, that is then used to calculate tax and total with tax; These values are placed in a totalTax and totalAfterTax variables, respectively.

The output for each variable is set to parseFloat(variable).toFixed(2); so the values are read as numbers by javascript and limited to two decimal places.
